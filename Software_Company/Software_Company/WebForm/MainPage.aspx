                        From its formation, the ICC had Lord's Cricket Ground as its home, and from 1993 had its
                offices in the "Clock Tower" building at the nursery end of the ground. The independent 
                ICC was funded initially by commercial exploitation of the rights to the World Cup of One
                Day International cricket. As not all Member countries had double-tax agreements with the
                United Kingdom, it was necessary to protect cricket's revenues by creating a company, ICC
                Development (International) Pty Ltd – known as IDI, outside the UK. This was established 
                in January 1994 and was based in Monaco.
